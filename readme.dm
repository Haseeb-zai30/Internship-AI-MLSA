# Internship – AI (MLSA)

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains the work I completed during my **Artificial Intelligence Internship** under the **Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors (MLSA)** program.  
The internship focused on building **practical AI/ML skills** through hands-on tasks, including **data preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and real-world applications**.  

Each task demonstrates step-by-step problem-solving using Python and popular machine learning libraries.
